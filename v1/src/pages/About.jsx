      <h1>About Danny Walsh</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am Danny Walsh. I am a senior at Santa Clara University majoring in Web Design & Engineering and minoring in Computer Science & Engineering.</p>
      <p>First and foremost, I am a front-end engineer. I work with JavaScript and React mainly to make web apps. I have also been researching webscraping to make large datasets for AI training. </p>
      <p>I am also very interested in hockey. I have been playing since I was three years old, and hope to make it a life-long passion. I am currently the President of the Santa Clara Club Ice Hockey team. Some of the responsibilities of this include recruiting, creating the schedule, reserving ice time, managing league membership, and organizing all other administrative aspects.</p>
      <p>Another passion of mine is cooking. I find it to be my favorite form of self care because it takes my entire mental capacity and doesn't allow me to think about other things. </p>
